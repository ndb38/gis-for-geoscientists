## Updated Geology FGDC Joint Symbol SVG Library

This is an update to the existing library available here [http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1694](http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1694). When the existing library is added to QGIS there were red lines adjacent to every joint symbol so I re-exported each SVG file from Illustrator. This library can be extracted and stored within the folder containing your existing SVG libraries (works in both QGIS and ArcMap).
